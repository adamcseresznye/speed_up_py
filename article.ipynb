    "Ever felt the need to turbo boost your Python code? Tired of the seemingly endless wait for your iterations or simulations to complete? Allow me to present the [`rustimport`](https://github.com/mityax/rustimport) library. In its most basic form, `rustimport` empowers you to call highly optimized Rust functions from within your code. This way, you can delegate the heavy-duty tasks to Rust, instead of relying on Python, a language known for its versatility but also for its slower speed. With `rustimport`, you can enjoy the best of both worlds - the simplicity of Python and the performance of Rust."

    "- The `is_prime(n)` function checks if a number n is prime. It starts by checking if n is less than or equal to 1, in which case it returns False as these are not prime numbers. It then checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of n. If n is divisible by any of these numbers, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True indicating that n is a prime number.\n",
    "- The `generate_primes(target)` function generates a list of prime numbers up to a given target number, which is in our case 1000. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the range from 2 to target (inclusive), calling the `is_prime(n)` function for each number n in the range. The result is a list of prime numbers.\n",
    "- The `longest_sum_of_consecutive_primes(primes, target)` function finds the prime number below a given target that can be written as the sum of the most consecutive primes. It starts with two variables, `max_length` and `max_prime`, initialized to 0. It then iterates over the primes list, for each prime calculating the sum of primes from the current prime to the end of the list. If the sum exceeds the target, it breaks the inner loop. If the sum is prime and the length of the sequence is greater than `max_length`, it updates `max_length` and `max_prime`. The function finally returns `max_prime` and `max_length`.\n",

The `generate_primes` function, which previously took 0.248 seconds, now completes in just 0.088 seconds. And thus our code went from taking 5.517 sec to just 0.092 sec...\n"
